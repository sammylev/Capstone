##Casting Agency Specifications
The Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. You are an Executive Producer within the company and are creating a system to simplify and streamline your process.

##Motivation
This is the final project for the Udacity fullstack program. Completing this project allows me to apply and practice many of the core key concepts learned in this course.

##Setup
Python 3.7
Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the python docs

Dependencies
Use pip to install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Heroku: https://udacity-casting-app.herokuapp.com/

##Authentication Setup
You can authenticate using the JWT tokens in test_app.py and SampleJWT.txt. These are valid until 3/25/2020.

New tokens can be pulled using the postman collection called udacity-getjwt-capstone
